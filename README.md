### IGNITE Project

IGNITE is an RPI study tool; an online repository of back exams. Browse, upload, and contribute at your leisure. Find back exams by clicking your major and course, then see all exams available for that class. Additionally, use our search bar for more complicated queries. Feel free to issue pull requests and discuss the project in our discord: *link here at some point*
